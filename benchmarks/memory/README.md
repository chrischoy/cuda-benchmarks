## Key Performance Insights

### 0. Memory Coalescing Impact
- **Coalesced column** access dramatically outperforms row-major for narrow matrices
- Example: 16K×8 matrix shows 302 GB/s vs 146 GB/s (2x improvement)
- Coalescing becomes less critical for wide matrices where vectorization dominates

### 1. Vectorization Benefits
- **Float8 vectorized** shows 2-3x improvement over element-wise for wide matrices
- Vectorization scales with matrix width (more columns = better performance)
- Diminishing returns beyond 8-element vectors

### 2. Matrix Size Thresholds
- **Small matrices** (< 64K rows): Coalescing and basic vectorization matter most
- **Medium matrices** (64K-1M rows): Advanced CUB patterns excel
- **Large matrices** (> 1M rows): Memory bandwidth becomes the bottleneck

### 3. CUB Library Performance
- **CUB methods** appear in some store operation rankings but not in load operations
- **CUB device cache-modified** and **CUB device store** show competitive performance for certain matrix sizes
- Generally outperformed by vectorized and coalesced approaches

## Performance Bottlenecks

0. **Memory bandwidth saturation** at ~15.6 TB/s for load operations
1. **Store operations** limited to ~3.4 TB/s regardless of method
2. **Small matrices** suffer from kernel launch overhead
3. **CuTe implementations** show suboptimal performance compared to hand-tuned kernels

## Optimization Recommendations

### For Load Operations:
0. **Wide matrices** (256+ columns): Use **Float8 vectorized** or **Coalesced float8**
1. **Medium matrices** (64-256 columns): **Coalesced float8** and **Float8 vectorized** perform best
2. **Narrow matrices** (< 64 columns): Prioritize **Coalesced column** access

### For Store Operations:
0. **Small matrices**: Use **Float4 vectorized** or **Coalesced float4**
1. **Large matrices**: Any vectorized method works (bandwidth-limited)
2. **Narrow matrices**: **Coalesced float4** provides best performance

### General Guidelines:
- **Memory coalescing** is crucial for narrow matrices
- **Vectorization** provides significant benefits for wide matrices
- **CUB library** methods can be competitive for store operations but are outperformed by vectorized approaches for loads
- **CuTe** shows promise but needs optimization for better performance
